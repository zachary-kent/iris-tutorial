(** * Case Study: Counter *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Implementation *)

(**
  Let us define a simple counter module. Our counter consists of three
  functions:
  - a constructor, [mk_counter], which creates a new counter starting at
    [0].
  - an increment function, [incr], which increments the counter and
    returns the old value of the counter.
  - a read function, [read], which reads the current value of the
    counter.
  Furthermore, we want the counter to be shareable across multiple
  threads, so we will implement [incr] with [CAS] as the synchronisation
  mechanism.
*)

Definition mk_counter : val :=
  λ: <>, ref #0.

Definition incr : val :=
  rec: "incr" "c" :=
  let: "n" := !"c" in
  let: "m" := "n" + #1 in
  if: CAS "c" "n" "m" then "n" else "incr" "c".

Definition read : val :=
  λ: "c", !"c".

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Defining a Representation Predicate for the Counter *)

Module spec1.
Section spec1.
Context `{heapGS Σ}.

(**
  We are going to keep the fact that our counter is built on a pointer
  as an implementation detail. Instead, we will define a predicate
  describing when a value is a counter.

  Note that [#n] uses an implicit coercion from [nat] to [Z] called
  [Z.of_nat]. So if you have trouble applying lemmas that should work,
  it is likely because there is a hidden coercion in the way.
*)

Definition is_counter1 (v : val) (n : nat) : iProp Σ :=
  ∃ l : loc, ⌜v = #l⌝ ∗ l ↦ #n.

(**
  This predicate is, however, not persistent, so our value would not be
  shareable across threads. To fix this, we can put the knowledge into
  an invariant.
*)

Let N := nroot .@ "counter".

Definition is_counter2 (v : val) (n : nat) : iProp Σ :=
  ∃ l : loc, ⌜v = #l⌝ ∗ inv N (l ↦ #n).

(**
  However, with this definition, we have locked the value of the pointer
  to always be [n]. To fix this, we could abstract the value and instead
  only specify its lower bound.
*)

Definition is_counter3 (v : val) (n : nat) : iProp Σ :=
  ∃ l : loc, ⌜v = #l⌝ ∗ inv N (∃ m : nat, l ↦ #m ∗ ⌜n ≤ m⌝).

(**
  We can now change what the pointer maps to, but we still cannot refine
  the lower bound.

  The final step is to use ghost state. The idea is to link [n] and [m]
  to pieces of ghost state in such a way that the validity of their
  composite is [n ≤ m].

  To achieve this, we will use the _authoritative_ resource algebra,
  [auth]. This resource algebra is parametrised by a CMRA, [A]. There
  are two types of elements in the carrier of the authoritative RA:
  - [● x] called an authoritative element
  - [◯ y] called a fragment
  where [x, y ∈ A].

  The idea of the authoritative RA is as follows. The authoritative
  element represents the whole of the resource, while the fragments act
  as the pieces. To achieve this, the authoritative element acts like
  the exclusive RA, while the fragment inherits all the operations of
  [A]. Furthermore, validity of [● x ⋅ ◯ y] is defined as [✓ x ∧ y ≼ x].

  In our case, we will use the authoritative RA over the [max_nat]
  resource algebra. The carrier of [max_nat] is the natural numbers, and
  the operation is the maximum.
*)
Context `{!inG Σ (authR max_natUR)}.

(**
  As such, [● (MaxNat m)] will represent the _true_ value of the counter
  [m], and [◯ (MaxNat n)] will represent a _fragment_ of the counter – a
  lower bound [n].
*)

Definition is_counter (v : val) (γ : gname) (n : nat) : iProp Σ :=
  ∃ l : loc, ⌜v = #l⌝ ∗ own γ (◯ MaxNat n) ∗
    inv N (∃ m : nat, l ↦ #m ∗ own γ (● MaxNat m)).

Global Instance is_counter_persistent v γ n :
  Persistent (is_counter v γ n) := _.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Properties of the Authoritative RA with MaxNat *)

(**
  Before we start proving the specification, let us prove some useful
  lemmas about our ghost state. For starters, we need to know that we
  can allocate the initial state we need.
*)
Lemma alloc_initial_state :
  ⊢ |==> ∃ γ, own γ (● MaxNat 0) ∗ own γ (◯ MaxNat 0).
Proof.
  (**
    Ownership of multiple fragments of state amounts to ownership of
    their composite. So we can simplify the goal a little.
  *)
  setoid_rewrite <- own_op.
  (** Now the goal is on the form expected by [own_alloc]. *)
  apply own_alloc.
  (**
    However, we are only allowed to allocate valid states. So we must
    prove that our desired state is a valid one.

    The validity of [auth] says that the fragment must be included in
    the authoritative element and the authoritative element must be
    valid.

(** ** A Simple Counter Client *)

(**
  To illustrate how this counter specification works, let us consider a
  simple concurrent client of our counter module, which increments a
  counter twice in parallel. Our specification will simply be that the
  value of the counter will be at least [1] afterwards.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** A Stronger Counter Specification *)

Module spec2.
Section spec2.

(**
  Our first specification only allowed us to find a lower bound for the
  value in [par_incr]. Any solution to this problem has to be
  non-persistent, as we need to aggregate the knowledge to conclude the
  total value.

  To this end, we will use fractions. The [frac] resource algebra is
  similar to [dfrac] but without the capability of discarding fractions.
  As such, [frac] consists of non-negative rationals with addition as
  composition, and a fraction is only valid if it is less than or equal
  to [1]. This means that all the fractions can add up to at most [1].
  Combining [frac] with other resource algebras allows us to keep track
  of how much of the resource we own, meaning we can do the exact kind
  of aggregation we need. So this time, we will use the resource algebra
  [authR (optionUR (prodR fracR natR))]. Here, [natR] is the natural
  numbers with addition.
*)

Context `{!heapGS Σ, !inG Σ (authR (optionUR (prodR fracR natR)))}.

Let N := nroot .@ "counter".

Definition is_counter (v : val) (γ : gname) (n : nat) (q : Qp) : iProp Σ :=
  ∃ l : loc, ⌜v = #l⌝ ∗ own γ (◯ Some (q, n)) ∗
    inv N (∃ m : nat, l ↦ #m ∗ own γ (● Some (1%Qp, m))).

(**
  With this definition, we can now decompose access to the counter by
  splitting the fraction, as well as splitting the knowledge of how much
  the counter has been incremented.

Lemma is_counter_add (c : val) (γ : gname) (n m : nat) (p q : Qp) :

(**
  When allocating a new state, there will be _one_ fragment, which
  contains the entire fraction. Using the above lemma, we can then split
  up the fragment and supply these fragments to participating threads.

  that, in particular, they must all be less than or equal to the
  authoritative element.

(**
  However, when a fragment has the entire fraction, there can't be any
  other fragments – intuitively, we have collected all contributions
  from all threads. So the count stored in the fragment must be equal to
  the one in the authoritative element.
